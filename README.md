mPay serves as the core platform of the Mose Pay ecosystem, functioning as both a Web2-era network technology hub and a Web3 full-stack technology platform. 
Developed under the leadership of Mose Pay with joint incubation by GTW Labs and Aztec Labs (Aztec Foundation), 
mPay focuses on building a Web3 ecosystem featuring payment public chains, full-chain wallets, and aggregated payment solutions, 
empowering Mose Pay to establish a global Web3 financial ecosystem.

mPay features a modular architecture design. Its underlying public chain integrates zk-SNARK privacy proofs with advanced cross-chain protocols like LayerZero and Aztec,
enabling multi-chain anonymous payments and centralized transaction processing. This approach allows mPay to maintain Ethereums security while delivering a more user-friendly,
privacy-preserving payment solution tailored for real-world compliance scenarios.
